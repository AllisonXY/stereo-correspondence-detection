# Stereo Correspondence Detection
## Description
This repository contains an implementation of the 8-point algorithm for stereo correspondence detection. The algorithm leverages epipolar geometry, random sample consensus, and singular value decomposition to enable estimation of the fundamental matrix and detection of matching points in stereo image pairs. The code and report were written by A. Cheng.
